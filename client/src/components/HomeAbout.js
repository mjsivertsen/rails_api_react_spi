  <h2>About this Application:</h2>
  <p> This is a single page application that was created using React, but the data contained herein is managed by an application programming interface which was created in Rails.  These two entities work together to create the webpage you are viewing.  React is responsible for rendering the pages that you are actually seeing, but rails is what allows you to store, add, update, and delete information.  I think.  That's my best explanation for the moment.</p>
